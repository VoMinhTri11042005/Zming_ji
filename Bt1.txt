The Battle of Ap Bac
The Battle of Ap Bac was a large-scale battle that took place in the early stages of the war between Vietnam and the United States with the result of the first major victory of the armed forces of the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (on the Vietnamese side) . The United States and the Republic of Vietnam (referred to as Viet Cong ) for regular troops of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam are commanded by American advisors. This battle took place on January 2, 1963 , near Ap Bac in My Tho province at that time (today Tien Giang province ), 65 km southwest of Saigon .
Circumstances
Small skirmishes, which developed during the Vietnam War, began in late 1954 with Ngo Dinh Diem 's anti-communist campaign . At that time, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam wanted a general election under the Geneva Agreement , which would unify the North and the South. This was destroyed by the increasing US aid to the South, and the policy of avoiding fighting at all costs. In this respect, Diem was very successful in keeping his army inactive, and small-scale skirmishes broke out throughout the South. The Democratic Republic of Vietnam was worried about American intervention and refused all military aid, they asked Viet Minh units toThe South retreated to the countryside and mountains. The situation increased, as the army of the Republic of Vietnam took a long time to find these areas, so the guerrillas had enough time to ambush and withdraw.
Force
The Army of the Republic of Vietnam mobilized a force consisting of an infantry battalion of the 7th Division and 2 security battalions, an armored brigade (13 M113 armored vehicles ) and 3 infantry companies (of which have 2 companies as reserve forces); about 8 bombers, 20 landing and armed helicopters , 11 observation and transport aircraft, 13 boats of all kinds and about 1 artillery battalion to support . In total, nearly 1,800 troops were led by American advisers. The attack at the beginning of the year was named Operation Duc Thang 01-1963. 
Developments
The Liberation Army applied the principle of not shooting reconnaissance aircraft and waiting to see what would happen next. One by one, three combat helicopters appeared, starting to fire machine guns and rockets . Waiting for the helicopter to approach, the Liberation Army fired a series of automatic guns and rifles from the irrigation canal. By hitting this ambush, by noon they knocked out 5 helicopters from the battle.
The ARVN 7th Division troops entering the hamlet from the north did not return to save the backup company and the helicopter crews. At 12:15, the Saigon battalion finally arrived at Tan Thoi. Then before 13 o'clock the M113 armored vehicles slowly approached the fields. The Liberation Army did not have anti-tank weapons, so they could not fight the M-113 armored vehicles effectively. In order to instill the courage of the troops to stand up against the armored vehicles with light weapons and grenades, the commanders of the Liberation Army made a list of the weak points of the armored vehicles : the machine gunner on the top of the stand. behind the gun rack exposed from the waist up, or can hit the driver through the sight slot, brave soldiers can approach and throw grenadeson the roof of the car. The commanders also taught the soldiers to focus on shooting at the M113 as if they had shot the plane. Each squad or platoon must choose the nearest vehicle and focus on it, not letting the firepower be scattered.
After a day of fighting, with 5 waves of attacks with the most new combat methods such as armored vehicles , helicopters , nets to launch javes... from many directions, including landing in the air by jumping . However , the ARVN troops were repelled. As a result in this battle, the ARVN had 83 people killed out of a total of nearly 200 casualties, 3 American advisers were killed and 16 American advisers and pilots were injured. On the Liberation Army side, 18 people died.
At 10 p.m. on the same day, the Liberation Army retreated vertically toward the Dong Thap Muoi base . Local militiamen and farmers in Ap Bac and Tan Thoi who supported them throughout the war also took a different route to shelter in the neighboring coconut forests. At the forefront were the main troops of Battalion 261 who resisted in Ap Bac. The local troops of the 514th Battalion moved to the rear with a platoon guarding the rear. The troops continued to go to a place to wade across the river, advance undetected, and arrive at the camp in Hung Thanh commune (Chau Thanh district) at 7 am.
Journalist Neil Sheehan wrote: They have done more than win a battle, bringing about a victory in the style of Vietnam as their ancestors have done for centuries. They have defeated an enemy stronger than them.. 350 Viet Cong held the battlefield and humiliated a modern army four times larger in size, armed with armored vehicles, heavy artillery, helicopters and bombers. Their most powerful weapon was a small, 60mm mortar, which was considered useless.They had 18 dead and 39 wounded, relatively light losses in a war that the Americans and Vietnamese under their protection. The defenders dumped thousands of rounds of normal and heavy machine gun ammunition, 600 rounds of mortars, napalm and bombs and other gifts carried on 13 aircraft and fivecombat helicopter. The Hueys alone poured 8400 machine-gun bullets and one hundred rockets on Ap Bac trees . With light weapons, the Viet Cong inflicted four times as much damage on them, killing about 80 Saigon soldiers, wounding more than 100; Three Americans died and eight were wounded, five helicopters shot down. The Viet Cong caused those losses while conserving ammunition. From the first salvoes with the security troops to the last salvoes with the paratroopers, they only used about 5,000 rounds of normal guns and machine guns.
American adviser John Paul Vann commented after the battle: They [the Liberation Army] were so brave, they gave us a good picture of who they are today.
The American book Vietnam War Encyclopedia praised the Liberation Army in Ap Bac as highly determined and well-trained soldiers, while evaluating the ARVN troops as incompetent, chaotic and cowardly.
The defeat of the US and the army of the Republic of Vietnam in this battle was not only a purely tactical defeat but also had strategic significance , which shook the American press and made the American people more concerned. to the Vietnam War. The NVA victory at Ap Bac marked the failure of the US Special War strategy in South Vietnam.
